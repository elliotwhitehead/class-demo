# Do these these for fewer headaches!

1. NEVER commit to master!
2. Try to divvy up the workload so everyone is working on their own branch (not always possible)
3. Commit early, and often. Push to GitHub less frequently. 
4. Update your branch often! (merge master / other people's work into your own branch as often as possible)
5. Communicate!
